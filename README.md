This is attempt to create a plugin for Sublime Text 3

two issues:
1. I'm using Sublime Text 3 which uses python3. The RPCroker is is using 
   python2.7. I'll need to switch to new version of the RPCBroker in order 
   to seemlessly call connect from python3.
2. I'm reading the sublime active window, so I'll need to change it to ask 
   for the file name without reading the sublime active window name.
